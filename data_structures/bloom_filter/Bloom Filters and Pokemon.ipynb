    "# TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    ">Bloom filters: \"Lightweight\" version of a hash table. Both hash tables and Bloom filters support efficient insertions and lookups. Bloom filters are more space efficient than hash tables, but this comes at the cost of having \"false positives\" for entry lookup. That is, Bloom filters can say with certainty that an element has not been inserted (no possibility of false negatives), but may indicate an element has been inserted when it has in fact not been (false positive). \n",
    "\n",
    "# When should I use a Bloom filter?\n",
    "\n",
    ">I want a data structure that allows for fast lookups and insertions. I care about how much space the data structure uses. I don't care if the data structure sometimes indicates an item is present when in fact it is not.\"\n",

    "## Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "I run a website and want to keep track of IP addresses that are blocked. I don't particularly care if a blocked IP address is occasionally able to access my website, but I do care if someone not on the blocked list is unable to access the site.\n",

    "Selecting the parameters for a Bloom filter is a relatively indirect process. Are we okay with accepting this for our purposes? Perhaps for catching Pokemon, this probability is low enough to be just fine for our purposes. However, if we want to push it a bit lower, can select a different value for $m$, recompute $k$, and see if the probability is any smaller. \n",
